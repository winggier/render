109.15 115.36 A: yeah we moved here. {laugh} I know that's very amazing. I'm still amazed {breath} haven't caught my breath yet. {laugh}  

116.36 118.47 A: It all happened so very quickly.  

119.05 121.45 B: Why did p- %um &Barry get a job or something?  

121.81 124.37 A: He has a job. He got one after we came here.  

125.04 125.92 B: oh great.  

126.08 127.29 A: Well it ((isn't))  

126.83 128.21 B: I bet your mom is thrilled.  

129.20 136.50 A: yeah yeah it was a good time to move. We were gone long enough to know what it was like to live other places and   

137.67 141.28 A: enjoyed other places and now it makes it more enjoyable to be back.  

141.53 142.09 B: yeah.  

142.70 144.74 A: And {breath} it was just right. {breath}   

145.55 152.16 A: We'd been praying for years what we were supposed to do. We always thought we were going to move to &Denver and live in my grandmother's house that had died.  

152.56 152.89 B: uh-huh.  

153.04 162.57 A: But that didn't work out and about two months ago one morning I told &Barry I said honey I said really think that we're to move to &Casper  

163.53 167.79 A: and the next day I talked to my granny and she had moved up here last year  

168.10 168.44 B: mhm.  

168.10 178.74 A: to be by mom {lipsmack} and she said she had felt that for a whole year after praying that we were to move here too she just had never said anything to anybody.  

179.28 179.82 B: mhm.  

180.07 180.66 A: And so  

182.12 188.89 A: she told me she had {breath} thought we should look for a house that had a big backyard and apartments that we could rent to pay the mortgage   

189.69 196.82 A: that she just thought there would be one we could find like that so we started looking on vacation a couple of mon- weeks ago  

197.99 208.69 A: and we found one it's a hundred and fifty thousand and I said granny I said we can't afford that she said well {breath} you know if that's what God wants he'll provide it {breath} so we did all the paperwork and the bank turned us down   

209.52 218.82 A: but then we did find the house. We found h- another one for half the price for sixty-six thousand had two apartments in the back that the lady had fixed up brand new  

220.51 229.27 A: and a big backyard for the kids with a big cedar fence just like grandma had thought we should have we found it and we are getting the house.  

229.87 230.90 B: That's great.  

231.15 231.94 A: yep she had prayed  

231.75 233.46 B: Are you staying with your mom at the moment?  

233.77 237.88 A: yep we're at mom's. It all happened so fast we just knew it was meant to be.  

238.11 238.63 B: Wow.  

238.28 243.14 A: Like everything fell in place. It's like {breath} God was taking care of it and we were the actors. {laugh}  

243.64 245.47 B: And &Barry found a job right away.  

245.02 248.67 A: yeah somebody hired him over the phone long distance. It was really weird.  

248.10 250.21 B: {lipsmack} So he finished school in &Omaha?  

250.38 250.65 A: yep.  

251.19 255.67 B: And he's doing %um like is it m- massage and stuff is that what it [distortion] 

255.32 259.95 A: Right well (( )) and a lot of physical therapy. He's at the &Shepherd &At &The &Valley &Nursing &Care &Center  

260.45 261.29 B: oh great.  

260.66 261.91 A: working with the older people.  

262.68 267.04 B: oh isn't that good. oh &Alison that means we get to spend so much time together when I come home.  

266.92 277.66 A: I know. You know a lady called me two weeks %uh there's a little old Christian Indian lady in &Omaha that I know God provided in my life because she's been such an encouragement to me and &Barry.  

268.04 268.40 B: oh.  

278.65 286.33 A: And %um her and her husband he's a l- %um just a real dear you know. {breath} And about two weeks before we moved here   

286.78 296.42 A: she called me at home and she said {breath} she'd been praying all morning for us and she said &Alison she said I c- {breath} I just felt real strong I needed to call and tell you that {breath} 

297.10 309.03 A: that God's taking you to your promised land and she said %um see she doesn't know my personal life you know we just share you know what I mean but she she doesn't know like me personally you know everything about us   

309.62 324.76 A: but it was amazing the insight she had into she said {breath} into us she said you know she said it just God showed me that you guys were made the best out of &Omaha and you were like the children of &Israel and you didn't complain and {breath} kick and scream in the wilderness you know. {laugh}  

325.06 325.45 B: yeah.  

325.29 336.23 A: And so because you were trusted God and made the best of it he's taking you to your promised land quicker than if you'd complained the whole time and she just had this wonderful   

337.04 339.88 A: oh it just gave me chills all over. I started crying.  

340.69 340.98 B: {lipsmack} oh.  

340.82 348.85 A: And and she said so you know just trust Him because he's taking you to where he wants you to be because you were faithful you know in &Omaha  

349.52 352.78 A: and it was kind of like a wilderness. We did make the best of it you know.  

352.98 353.35 B: yeah.  

353.42 364.31 A: But her insight was so perceptive. I started crying. I was like oh that's wonderful. {laugh} And so then she says well we love you good bye. {laugh}  

364.76 365.36 B: aw.  

365.20 367.45 A: And that is what it was like too you know.   

368.06 370.18 A: We made the best of it tried not to complain  

368.50 371.09 B: You really have ((to)) yeah.  

371.02 376.21 A: and made the best of it and then this is like the promised land to us. It might not be to someone else you know.  

376.74 377.08 B: mhm.  

377.26 378.25 A: But for us it is.  

378.62 379.12 B: yeah.  

379.17 386.56 A: And then I was thinking just like you said if you come down here {breath} around Christmas time I won't have to worry about getting up here you know.  

386.95 394.26 B: I know it that's going to be great. {breath} I'm supposed to be there I'm going to go to &Denver first and then I'll come ((up)) [distortion] to &Casper on December fourth
