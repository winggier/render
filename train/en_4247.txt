141.81 143.99 A: Great.  What should we talk about? {laugh}  

145.20 149.05 B: Well I don't know. Tell me what's going on in &America. I haven't seen the news in ages. [line static] 

149.26 149.68 A: Really?  

150.28 150.60 A: You did d-  

150.40 152.55 B: In the American news I mean I know what's going on in &Russia but  

153.06 156.85 A: yeah. Well let's see. What's going on? %uh  

157.78 159.28 A: You want me to just give you some headlines?  

160.46 162.80 B: yeah. Give me some headlines. What's &Clinton up to?  

161.62 162.04 A: {lipsmack} {breath} up-  

162.88 168.77 A: yeah. I was just going to say &Clinton just came out yesterday with his %uh his statement concerning affirmative action.  

169.90 170.38 B: uh-huh.  

170.44 176.55 A: And, and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of %uh  

177.58 182.23 A: you know of making %um al-  allowances strictly based on race  

182.93 186.49 A: but at the same time %uh the analysis in the news  

186.48 189.98 A: {breath} shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that  

190.13 196.02 A: &Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems 

196.55 201.06 A: and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action  

201.08 204.97 A: is necessary {inhale} to move %uh you know black Americans {inhale} 

205.13 207.77 A: forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been denied.   

207.78 210.92 A: So he's trying to, k- kind of walking a tight rope. You know what I'm saying? 

211.45 211.81 B: Right.  

212.25 213.17 A: In other words {breath} l-  

212.71 214.01 B: He's trying to please everybody.  

213.89 217.65 A: yeah. Let's see if we can make everybody happy [[says laughing]] {laugh} 

217.27 217.90 B: {laugh}  

218.10 218.96 A: I think that he's  

218.87 220.76 B: Then he just ends up making nobody happy.  

220.68 226.13 A: I think you're right. {laugh} Because you know affirmative action is really under attack in the &United &States on,  

226.20 229.11 A: from many different quarters right now. And, and it's a big, {breath}  

229.11 233.85 A: it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender, I mean not a gender a race  

234.46 239.74 A: %uh color blind we're supposed to be race color blind and yet {breath} it's like contractors  

240.20 243.85 A: that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than  

244.13 251.38 A: -- the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever. 

252.05 252.89 A: And it's really you know  
 
252.52 252.92 B: Right.  

253.05 257.82 A: And then, then so they're taking lawsuits to the &Supreme &Court and all of this so it's {breath} 

257.63 258.07 B: Wow.  

258.28 267.54 A: Another thing that just came up was that the &Supreme &Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in &Georgia  

268.54 274.41 A: violated the &Constitution because it was based primarily on race.  

276.26 277.26 A: There was you know a new  

277.00 283.34 B: What did they do i- They were doing it because they were trying to make it more e- like they were trying to make it less segregated? 

284.18 292.31 A: They were trying to make the district majority black Americans so therefore they drew it %uh all the way across the state. 

292.98 293.70 A: You see what I'm saying?  

293.47 295.19 B: oh right. uh-huh.  

294.14 299.69 A: a, a very narrow district and it created a majority black district which then elected  

300.19 307.73 A: a, a black representative and then it was challenged because it said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to ensure that it was  

308.20 310.51 A: majority black {inhale} and that's not  

310.44 310.84 B: ((right))  

311.45 311.81 A: you know  

316.37 316.85 A: Hello?  

318.19 318.84 B: I'm here.  

318.80 319.89 A: okay. {breath} Anyway  

319.60 320.95 B: I'm mulling all this over.  

321.32 322.21 A: yeah. I mean it's, it   

322.07 325.56 B: So it's interesting because today we had a discussion with students about %um 

326.04 329.38 B: because we're doing a pre-departure orientation so we were, we had our hot topics  

329.87 333.76 B: discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about like political correctness  

333.77 336.82 B: and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment, feminism and  

337.23 341.55 B: just like different topics that they might encounter in &America where the people have different attitudes than here in &Russia.  

342.52 344.24 B: So that was one of the things ((kind of like that)) [distortion]  

345.27 349.14 B: But I have I'm not really up on what the attitude is in &America because I haven't been there in so long. {laugh}  

349.62 355.86 A: Well there's a lot of frustration I think over the fact that there're, there're a number of evidences that the affirmative action  

356.50 363.45 A: program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people are saying wait a minute. Why don't we just give everybody %uh  

363.62 369.63 A: %uh %uh an e- try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race {breath} 

369.80 374.00 A: go at it from the standpoint of, of trying to remedy it through the courts {breath}  

374.06 379.80 A: rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what.  

380.76 381.11 B: Right.  

381.41 386.76 A: And as a result some %uh m- some people are getting contracts just because  

387.11 390.69 A: of the color of their skin and you know what I'm saying it's, it's, it's still  

390.21 392.16 B: When they might not even be the most qualified.  

392.31 395.26 A: e- either them they're, they're not even, they're not the low bid  

395.59 400.05 A: you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality spec- specification.  

401.05 401.51 B: Right.  

401.55 405.67 A: And but now you've, there have been several cases where clearly you know it was,  

405.81 409.41 A: they didn't get it because {laugh} they just didn't weren't the right color skin. 

409.79 410.46 A: So now is that  

410.19 410.53 B: Right.  

410.78 416.11 A: is that really remedying the situation or is it's creating a lot of %uh of %uh resentment?  

417.00 417.54 A: And %uh  

417.23 417.69 B: Right.  

417.82 418.97 A: it's kind of too bad. How long  

418.61 419.56 B: God what a mess.  

420.00 422.84 A: oh it's a mess. It really is. W- how long have you been there by the way?  

424.52 427.21 B: Over here?  %um it'll be three years in November.  

427.58 427.96 A: Wow.  

428.51 430.90 A: So you really are out of touch aren't you? {laugh}  

431.79 434.47 B: Well [[says laughing]] I like to think I'm not totally out of touch {laugh}  

434.10 435.40 A: Well y- I know what it's like.  

434.85 438.36 B: {inhale} I was never very in touch even when I was still &America so. {laugh}  

438.40 441.43 A: oh okay. You're that type. I got you. {laugh}  

440.78 443.55 B: {laugh} I was always in my, in my own world anyway so.  

444.29 450.36 A: {inhale} Well I know what it's like because I've went, having lived over in &Korea for almost three years %um it's  

450.62 455.41 A: you know when you come back all of a sudden the you know the society has changed a little bit you know. 

455.99 456.66 B: uh-huh.  

456.68 460.97 A: New terminology. New buzzwords. And all that stuff.  

460.44 460.90 B: Right.  

463.11 469.39 A: Of course when you get to be over forty like me %um, you can miss that stuff just being an American anyway.  

469.70 470.36 A: {laugh}  

470.29 471.05 B: {laugh}  

471.19 472.37 A: {inhale} It all passes  

472.10 477.44 B: I don't know. I always think when you get older you're more informed. When I was in college I didn't know what was going on. I was too busy.   

477.77 482.82 A: yeah. I'm thinking of %uh you know like %uh lingo that the young people come up with you know.  

484.08 484.54 B: {laugh}  

484.18 489.89 A: Younger people. yeah. {breath} I think I'm more informed now than I was in college. I was sort of out of it in college.  

491.51 494.51 A: But %uh by the way u- d- did I tell you that I have a new job? 

496.28 500.80 B: Well in your email you said that you're going to start your new job somewhere. You didn't say what your new job was.  

500.98 510.04 A: oh okay.{inhale} %um I'm resigned here last week effective August tenth and I'll be taking the job of the director of English language %um

527.56 529.37 A: -- you send people into E S L programs?  

531.18 537.12 B: Well we get requests about it. I don't know how many people actually go because a lot of them you know don't have a lot of money but we get  

537.24 539.75 B: students every year that ask about it that say they have money.  

540.08 540.67 A: Well you can be  

540.36 542.63 B: They usually don't come though and tell us whether or not they go.  

542.96 547.55 A: {lipsmack} yeah. Well you can be sure that we will send you information {breath} because %uh  

548.00 552.40 A: you know I've got to go down there and we're trying to r- to improve the program we're adding 

552.44 556.07 A: {breath} they're adding thousands of dollars of %uh state of the art language e-  

556.10 560.99 A: you know equipment %uh lab equipment and all of that and they're restructuring everything so 

561.76 563.93 A: {breath} that's what I'm supposed to do next. {laugh}  

564.66 566.34 B: Do they have any scholarships for foreign students?  

567.61 573.03 A: I, I'm , I've never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally but I think  

572.79 576.34 B: We never did either but I keep thinking I'm going to find one of these days {laugh}.  

575.87 583.03 A: yeah. I know. I'm sure that they pro- {breath}  You know I e- the question of whether they have scholarships for international students %um 

583.04 587.47 A: for the regular program is a good one and I'd like to find out. I'd like to think that they do 

588.30 588.89 A: and, and I think  

588.61 588.91 B: uh-huh.  

589.22 591.09 A: they might but I don't know yet.

617.10 619.66 B: I know the one, the great one that was so much fun.  

619.92 624.58 A: oh it was a blast but I'm not sure it was more fun than &Miami I mean you know. {laugh} But it  

624.37 625.15 B: {laugh}  

625.28 629.86 A: it was fun though. You would have enjoyed it and as I said to you in the email the %uh  

629.84 634.28 A: the &Russians and the &Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious. I mean we had a,  

634.79 638.28 A: we had a nice little visit. We really did. {inhale} %uh it's too bad I didn't

643.63 645.63 A: oh really? You didn't know that? {laugh}  

645.07 649.93 B: {inhale} Well because you wouldn't say that. Because in Russian it's just you know <Russian: &Lyubov> but it's just a Russian name. I mean you wouldn't 

650.34 654.80 B: think of translating it into English but the thought of people calling her &Lovie in &America is so funny.
