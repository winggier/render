778.78 785.04 B: And it just they just come to life you know it's really neat I like it a lot and then I have %um   

786.88 794.32 B: then I have %um my Jewish Culture class %um taught by rabbi &Rosen  

795.19 804.39 B: he's really really good really good teacher %um and %ah tha- that's been interesting to to learn about yeah

813.74 819.66 B: %um cool words and in his British accident accent it just it just kind of sounds kind of neat {laugh}  

819.85 827.79 B: he's an he's a neat figure he's really %um energetic and anyway %um he %ah  

829.88 839.26 B: and then there's this Arab Civilization class that I take from %um from Brother (( )) he's an Arab here  

839.55 848.72 B: a very prominent Arab %um Muslim down here he really was influential in %um getting the center built here  

849.57 857.90 B: he worked with President &Hunter a lot that knew him very well he is so neat and I wrote I wrote this in my letter so you'll get it twice but    

859.01 868.33 B: %um he was talking to us one time in one of our classes and he was saying %um somebody asked him he's known as a dry Mormon  

868.87 874.46 B: down here and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant and and he said  

875.13 883.72 B: he just started he kind of laughed and he started going on about how he first came in contact with the church and President &Hunter and  

884.50 891.88 B: and %uh he said and he just started getting all he got all choked up you know and started to cry   

892.52 899.58 B: and %ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself but he said ((%um)) he said that 

900.92 905.41 B: he said that he always felt like in &Islam they believe that &Mohammed was a prophet  

905.97 906.26 A: %hm  

906.17 911.60 B: And they believe in all the other prophets that the &Old &Testament and the &New &Testament you know that &Jesus was a prophet ((an-))  

912.53 918.70 B: anyway but they believe that &Mohammed was the last prophet you know and so he was the seal of the prophet   

918.90 924.31 B: they don't worship em him or anything they just believe that he was a prophet and and %um  

924.91 932.90 B: anyway he said it always didn't seem right to me that God would not send any more prophets down to the earth that &Mohammed would be the last one   

933.41 940.79 B: that he wouldn't give his people guidance you know that that would be it you know because he's seen a lot in his religion  

941.41 948.38 B: answers that they don't have and problems that you know people kind of go astray in these different ways because they don't know  

949.11 957.84 B: you know and it's funny because I learn about the Jewish religion and it's the same thing you see all of these divisions happening and all of these questions and you ask  

958.14 965.99 B: you know there's the old joke %um if you ask %ah three Jewish men a question you'll get four opinions  

966.51 967.62 A: {laugh}  

966.78 968.93 B: You know tha- I mean they're just   

969.30 974.88 B: they're very you know you you really do {laugh} I've talked to several of them you really get different things  

974.91 980.38 B: because you know there's the ultra orthodox and the reformed and the anyway %um  

981.14 988.97 B: and so he was just saying that %ah he never thought that that was right and he said when I %um  

989.43 997.66 B: whenever I am with your prophet President &Hunter I he says I cannot explain it it's just a feeling inside   

998.08 999.54 B: and then he'd say do you know what I mean  

999.82 1001.78 B: and we were all just silent you know and  

1001.71 1002.19 A: {laugh}  

1002.03 1004.19 B: and just nodding our heads and he says  

1003.47 1004.47 A: yup {laugh}  

1004.39 1009.85 B: he says I just cannot help but feel that that this is a man of God
